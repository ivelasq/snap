# Extracting SNAP Expenditure Data

# Introduction

In 2016, the USDA released a study entitled “Foods Typically Purchased by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Households,” including a summary, final report, and appendices.

These data are available on the [FNS website](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/foods-typically-purchased-supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap-households) as PDF's and they do not provide the data in easily readable formats.

Using `tabulizer` and the tidyverse, I was able to extract these tables into CSVs.
